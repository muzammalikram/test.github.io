A survey conducted by Collective Basis discovered that,</p><blockquote id="c300" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a=""><p>70% of millennial consumers are influenced by recommendations of their peers in buying decisions.</p></blockquote><p id="bf30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote" data-v-c245736a="">Currently, there are numerous, critical inefficiencies within the influencer marketing campaign process. Brands spend a significant, yet arduous proportion of their workflow on contracting, post verification, and payment settlement. This inefficiency is a critical problem that Buttrfly addresses. To reduce the time spent on this process, Buttrfly will maximize the benefits of the blockchain technologies through the use of smart contracts.</p><p id="6f8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a=""><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong" data-v-c245736a="">Inefficiency #1 — Contracting</strong></p><p id="6214" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a="">The process of contracting is time-consuming and heavy on human resources. For each influencer that a brand engages with, the brand must draft an agreement, negotiate terms, and get the influencer to sign the agreement. If a brand works with under 10 influencers this process can be easily accomplished, but if a brand ramps up and engages with 100+ influencers, than the process is both unscalable and laborious.</p><p id="2d2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a=""><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong" data-v-c245736a="">Inefficiency #2 — Payment Settlement</strong></p><p id="4968" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a="">The payment settlement process includes sending out a W9 for completion, receiving and processing said W9, receiving an invoice, and tendering payment. Similar to contracting, this process is labor intensive and can not successfully scale.</p><p id="3ce3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a=""><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong" data-v-c245736a="">Inefficiency #3 — Post Verification</strong></p><p id="b0b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a="">Post verification is also plagued with laborious tasks. This process includes both verifying that an influencer posts content, as specified in their contract, and verifying the engagement levels of the post. Currently, brands accomplish this by having a representative review each post and/or the influencer documents the post in a report.</p><p id="95c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a=""><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong" data-v-c245736a="">Buttrfly — The solution</strong></p><p id="7efe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" data-v-c245736a="">Buttrfly is a blockchain marketplace for brands to scale their influencer marketing. Our platform will use smart contracts to automate contracting, verification, and settlement into a, self-executing process.
